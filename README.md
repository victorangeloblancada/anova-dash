# ANOVA in Dash

An interactive Dash web app that performs analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Clone the repo and run `python anova-dash.py` to start the Dash server. The web app would then be accessible at localhost:8080. You can use the ANOVA.xlsx file to test the app but it can accept any Excel spreadsheet or CSV.
